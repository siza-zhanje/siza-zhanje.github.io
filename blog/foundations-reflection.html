          <h3>What are three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning?&#63;
          </h3>
          
          <div class="difference">
            <p>
              I can now apply ‘not yet’ to my overall learning.
My EQ must be high because of the resonance I sensed have a quiet nature - always thought I was outgoing & really to put myself forward!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
  Values: 
  Working hard and not giving up. Being a person of integrity when programming means I can write code that others will be able to read easily, and maintain if necessary 
  Empathy: 
  When something is familiar to me or I’ve grasped the concept quickly, understanding that it may not be the case for my team members, is key to me putting myself forward to help them e.g. replying to a question in Discord or offering a screen share helps us both grow and learn. 
  In programming, it should create a mutually productive atmosphere especially during pair-programming.
  Self-awareness: 
  Knowing that my current state of being affects how well I learn and retain new and copious amounts of information. When  programming, my ability to apply sound logic to the solution I’m trying to code and the time-of-day that I code influence the overall outcome.

<h3>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
Applying ‘not yet’ to my learning has been revolutionary and stress relieving  
</p>
</div>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
  Identity, Values, and Strengths because I could not relate them to my culture. I have lived in Western culture most of my life and do feel at odds with both of them most of the time.   
</p>
</div>  
<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
  We had the Human Skills team introduction this morning and they reiterated that people are at the centre of the solutions we write in code. Being able to understanding people is what makes for an exceptional programmer. 
</p>
<p>
  My understanding of this is: I’ll need to cater for the non-technical client in the same way as I would a technical one. The difference will be in the  way I explain back to them, what they need in a solution versus what they want in an empathetic way. Understanding my team’s (organization’s) values will help me find a meeting ground to satisfy both sides, if possible.   
</p>
</div>

<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
  I have found studying Core very interesting. It has given me a balance, maybe, a softer side to programming which I wasn’t fully aware of before. I now know of myself, that my scheduled breaks, exercise etc. have not been enough to take me completely from writing code. Working through the Core material has been a welcome break!
