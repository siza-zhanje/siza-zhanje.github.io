  <h3> DISC Personality Test</h3>
  <p>
    The DISC (Dominant-Influence-Steady-Compliant) Personality Test is the tool I found to be the most accurate in helping me identify and name the values most important to me. I am a perfectionist, although I&#39;d prefer not to be at times.

<h3>Stories demonstrating this trait
</h3>

<div class="difference">
  <p>
    In my work as a software developer sole trader working part-time, I would not allow myself to use any drag-and-drop tools for the applications I was building. I preferred to build from scratch and put a lot of effort. Whilst this was beneficial in learning how to code, I would spend time over the minutest detail - the old “not seeing the wood for the trees”. I over ran my budget and the client deadline, but the result was satisfying.

    I am glad for the time spent learning Ubuntu terminal because it is working very well in the MacOS terminal. This would not surprise others, but it was for me.
