  <h3> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>

  <div class="difference">
  <p>
    The brain is constantly changing and is capable to receiving, retaining new information all the time. This means that learning at any age or stage in life is possible because we are not born clever. Intelligence is malleable! Even just imagining something before actually doing it, develops the same area in the brain. 
    </p>
    <p>
      People with lost limbs for example, can feel where the limb used to be. They can learn to function without that specific limb. People with behavioural issues can be taught to change these into positive ones. This is because neuroplasticity is activity driven &#45; causing new neuron connections to form and strengthening existing ones, frequently used. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Due to neuroplasticity applying the use&#63;it&#63;or&#63;lose&#63;it rule, infrequently used neutrons become weaker to the point of eventually being pruned.

<h3>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit.
</h3>

<div class="difference">
  <p>
    Practice ALL of the time what I&#39;ve learnt so that I get better and more efficient in applying the knowledge in relevant ways. 
    If I can apply my acquired knowledge relevantly and somehow link it to other prior knowledge, it will make sense. Recalling the information will become easy. Using an analogy will help me explain it in simple terms so that my all levels of my audience has the same understanding.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>  <!--TODO as a list -->
  Imagine what I am trying to do <em>before</em> I actually do it because my brain uses the same area, frontal cortex, to action what I an imagining to do.
Approach new information with the understanding that my brain has the capacity to take it in; in fact, that this new learning is healthy for my brain, which will reshape itself to accommodate the real-estate now required.

  <h3> What is Growth Mindset&#63;</h3>
 
   <p>
    A growth mindset is a not yet attitude, meaning that if I&#45; m struggling to grasp a concept or to recall something that I&#39;ve learnt or to apply it in a relevant way, it doesn&#45; t mean that I am useless at it or am a failure. If simply means that I&#45; m not yet grasping, recalling or applying that concept or learning.

   <h3> why it is relevant&#63; </h3>
   <div class="difference">
   <p>
It is relevant because it changes the way I think about learning. I&#45; ve often heard that people will learn only what they are interested in. In actual fact, people can learn anything anytime. A growth mindset gives me space and time I need to learn what I want and need to learn. At anytime.

 <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise me&#63;
 </h3>
 
 <div class="difference">
   <p>
    The surprise for me was just how revolutionary “not yet” thinking is! I wish that I&#45; d learnt this when I was growing up in school because I would have applied it my own learning from a younger age and I would definitely have taught it to my children. 
  </p>

  <h3>In this exploration, did anything change for me&#63;
  </h3>
  <p>
    It has changed me in that I&#45; m kinder to myself when a would-be solution is not working the way I expect it to work. This even before seeking help.
  </p>

 <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey&#63;</h3> 
 
 <div class="difference">
 <p>
  I am already practicing it now, especially when struggling to apply responsiveness to blog, not yet got me through to a point where I feel better about my blog. I am finding that it is another tool to reduce my stress levels and keeping me calm.

 <h3>How these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy
</h3>

<div class="difference">
  <p>
    I&#45; d like to change my approach to difficult problems by looking at them as a chance to create more new neurone connections to keep my brain active and healthy. If I draw on prior knowledge as well, that this will also strengthen my existing neurones.
  </p>
<p>
  As a confessed perfectionist, adopting the kinder, “not yet” mind set means that I don&#45; t have to get everything done, or right, the first time. This may help me get more  creative, take a few more risks,  in my approach to problem solving. An added benefit is that my strategy could change to one of producing solutions that are concise and clear as well as work as intended! This would be GREAT!
