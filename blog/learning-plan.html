    <div class="answer">
      <p>
         Every morning I get up early to exercise before I start work. At my desk is a flask  of water which I sip often. I ensure that I get up & grab a fruit and/or refill my flask at every break. Getting a good night’s sleep especially during the week by switching off my computer by 9pm daily. Then spending at lest 30 min to unwind before bed.

        Remembering to practice positive self talk when I am struggling to find a solution even before reaching out of help. 
        Thinking about how I phrase my questions so it is clear what I am asking increases my sense of achievement when my question is answered.
        Receiving regular hugs from my family helps me feel content and reciprocally, being kind when my children interrupt me!

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Long term goal and/or career pathway</h3>
      </div>
        <div  class="answer">
        <p>
        My long term goal is games development, possibly with back end development focus. However, I am leaning towards general applications development. Exposure to the back-end aspects of programming will help me make a decision. At the moment, I'd just like to gain more hands-on experience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</h3>
    </div>
<div class="answer">
        <p> Being very focused and motivated to learn; planning my day and spending time to reflect on that day's work and seeking help when I have exhausted my own efforts remain as my biggest strengths. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Being late to recognize when I am about to hit-the-wall is now my biggest limitation. This has happened twice during Foundations and both times, after long days with poor sleep quality, even though daily exercise and prayer, regular breaks, hydration, sunlight etc have been observed. This could be an issue when pair programming. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3></div>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Mental endurance to stay on course until the problem is solved will be a challenge for me. The first two JavaScript Carnival challenges took me longer to solve than the time box suggestions. I did not take a break in between so I found myself mentally drained going into the last of the challenges. This observation about me is new.
        </p>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Human skills to developed while at Dev Academy</h3>
      </div>
       <div class="answer">  
       <p>
        Clearly explaining a response when I offer to help a cohort member e.g in answering a question Discord; or when I am approached for help, to do so in a logical and simple way that makes their understanding easier. 
      </p>
        <p>As I write, I think when it comes to it, how I perform as a <em>Driver</em> during pair programming could be something I measure when I receive feedback. At present, I feel like my own thought process can be unordered despite my best pseudo code.
        </p>

        <p>When I think of myself as a leader, I visualize myself leading from behind the scenes. Strange to think this as I do not consider myself an introvert! All the same, I would like to develop leadership skills especially as my self confidence in writing code grows.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>My expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer"> 
        <p>
          Mainly to continue to be readily available, as they have been during Foundations. Their experience, compassion and patience have been stellar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe the ratio will be better during boot camp so I would like more screen sharing opportunities when I get stuck. Posting my questions in Discord works for me when I know <em>exactly</em> what I am asking. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, where it is a bit blurred with those obscure issues e.g. where my code should work but continues to fail with trouble shooting, David's well trained eyes have spotted the error almost immediately. This has got me going again a lot quicker.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
        I expect myself to persevere no matter how hard I think it is, especially when I want to cry from exhaustion, frustration and missing my family. This, by reminding myself of the wonderful opportunity I have been blessed with and the fact that nine weeks is NOT a long time in the bigger scheme of things!
        </p>

        <p>Above all I expect to back myself up by cultivating my <em><strong>not yet</strong></em> mind set and enjoying every clean concice working code that I write.
        </p>

        <p>
        Just-in-Time learning has helped me keep up during Foundations, enabling me to hand in each sprint work well on time. My goal is to continue to apply this principle. Keeping up with the expected higher workload, I will be revisiting code written in earlier challenges more often than I have done during Foundations. Applying prior knowledge is what I also want to develop further during bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
        To work productively, my mind needs to fully switch off by bed time and stay off until I start next day. Prayerful meditation is helping me in this area.

    <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    
<div class="question">
<h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
</h3>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  I am very focused when I set myself to learn and easily remove anything that impedes my concentration levels. My best is finding out how to do things then attempting to apply what I have found, even though I get mixed results at times.
</p>

<p>
  However, the perfectionist part of me means that I can take a long time to get a result. Working under extreme pressure makes me worry that the quality I want to present will be diminished in the rush to get everything done on time. The interesting effect is improved time management.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h3> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
  </h3>

<div class="answer">  
<p>
    During the course, I&#39;d like to:
    better manage my stress levels
    increase positive self-thoughts and talk
    take time to check my understanding of what is required
    formulate my questions better so as to be easily understood
    Make myself available to my cohort members even when I am under pressure
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
    ◦	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
  ◦	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you

    Apply the Just-In-Time learning principle all the time so that I am &#39;doing&#39; most of the time Adopt a not-yet attitude when I&#39;m struggling to understand/remember concepts that I feel I should already know.Continue to work to my set time table incorporating the pomodoro timerBeing on the whai cohort, I see safety in my learning extends to how I keep my study area free of any hazards
  </p>

  <p>
    Walk away! I&#39;m loving the pomodoro timer in this regard. Often, I&#39;ve found the solution when I&#39;m not looking at the issue/problem. 
  </p>
  <p>
I plan to keep up my daily exercise routine. 
</p>
<p>
    At the moment, my longest break is at the end of the day, when I&#39;ve reignited the joy of cooking! During this time, I catch up with my family. Hearing their stories/needs takes my mind off.
</p>

<p>
    I have been mostly, been following the advice to seek help when I haven&#39;t resolved any problems on my own within 15minutes. However, for the website challenge, that went out the window unfortunately. The trouble was started when I couldn&#39;t decide how to &#39;copy&#39; the resource files onto my computer. So I went on to the nest step, following along on a random website. It seems that I didn&#39;t quite settle down as I “forgot” everything I&#39;d learnt when I came to design & build my site! I worked into the night before I realised that I&#39;d done what I shouldn&#39;t have done - go down a rabbit hole.
</p>
<p>
  I requested a screen share with David which helped me immensely. His calmness was very re-assuring and I was able to complete the exercise. Even though he was busy, thank you for not sounding rushed.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>
  A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h3>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>
  My commitment is to look through the Discord channels for one I believe best fits my question; to read through the posts to see if there may be an answer already. If not, post my question and wait up to 10 min for a reply. If no reply, to then reach out to David and/or Joseph, first; Gerard  second; other facilitators; the Help Desk and finally after-hours-support. 
</p>
<p>
  I expect the facilitation team to keep up being timely in their responses to questions, being encouraging and patient. As David told me, to tell me know if I&#39;m building something that will cause me issues does the track! I really appreciated him saying so. I expect protection from cohort/team members as was done during our Homegroup &#39;Catch-up&#39; when David spoke to us about comparing ourselves to our past selves rather than comparing ourselves to other team members.

<div class="question">
  <h3>
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
    Yes please. On rainy days, I&#39;d like to be able to drop off & pick up my daughter from school and if I&#39;m stuck arranging sports run, to have a block-out time so I don&#39;t feel guilty or stressed. These have been arranged and planned for before starting the course but it may be that something crops up unexpectedly with my helpers and I need that time away.
