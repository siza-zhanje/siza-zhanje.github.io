    <div class="question">
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        My long term is to work as a Full Stack software developer. The dream for me would be developing software games even though I do not play computer games.
      </p>

<div class="question">
<h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
</h3>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  I am very focused when I set myself to learn and easily remove anything that impedes my concentration levels. My best is finding out how to do things then attempting to apply what I have found, even though I get mixed results at times.
</p>

<p>
  However, the perfectionist part of me means that I can take a long time to get a result. Working under extreme pressure makes me worry that the quality I want to present will be diminished in the rush to get everything done on time. The interesting effect is improved time management.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h3> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
  </h3>

<div class="answer">  
<p>
During the course, I&#39;d like to:
learn better manage my stress levels
increase positive self-thoughts and talk
take time to check my understanding of what is required
formulate my questions better so as to be easily understood
Make myself available to my cohort members even when I am under pressure
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
	◦	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
	◦	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
</h3>
</div>

<div class="answer">  
  <p>
Apply the Just-In-Time learning principle all the time so that I am &#39;doing&#39; most of the time 
Adopt a not-yet attitude when I&#39;m struggling to understand/remember concepts that I feel I should already know.
Continue to work to my set time table incorporating the pomodoro timer
Being on the whai cohort, I see safety in my learning extends to how I keep my study area free of any hazards
  </p>

  <p>
    Walk away! I&#39;m loving the pomodoro timer in this regard. Often, I&#39;ve found the solution when I&#39;m not looking at the issue/problem. 
  </p>
  <p>
I plan to keep up my daily exercise routine. 
</p>
<p>
At the moment, my longest break is at the end of the day, when I&#39;ve reignited the joy of cooking! During this time, I catch up with my family. Hearing their stories/needs takes my mind off.
</p>

<p>
I have been mostly, been following the advice to seek help when I haven&#39;t resolved any problems on my own within 15minutes. However, for the website challenge, that went out the window unfortunately. The trouble was started when I couldn&#39;t decide how to &#39;copy&#39; the resource files onto my computer. So I went on to the nest step, following along on a random website. It seems that I didn&#39;t quite settle down as I “forgot” everything I&#39;d learnt when I came to design & build my site! I worked into the night before I realised that I&#39;d done what I shouldn&#39;t have done - go down a rabbit hole.
</p>
<p>
I requested a screen share with David which helped me immensely. His calmness was very re-assuring and I was able to complete the exercise. Even though he was busy, thank you for not sounding rushed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h3>
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h3>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>
  My commitment is to look through the Discord channels for one I believe best fits my question; to read through the posts to see if there may be an answer already. If not, post my question and wait up to 10 min for a reply. If no reply, to then reach out to David and/or Joseph, first; Gerard  second; other facilitators; the Help Desk and finally after-hours-support. 
</p>
<p>
  I expect the facilitation team to keep up being timely in their responses to questions, being encouraging and patient. As David told me, to tell me know if I&#39;m building something that will cause me issues does the track! I really appreciated him saying so. I expect protection from cohort/team members as was done during our Homegroup &#39;Catch-up&#39; when David spoke to us about comparing ourselves to our past selves rather than comparing ourselves to other team members.

<div class="question">
  <h3>
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    </div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Yes please. On rainy days, I&#39;d like to be able to drop off & pick up my daughter from school and if I&#39;m stuck arranging sports run, to have a block-out time so I don&#39;t feel guilty or stressed. These have been arranged and planned for before starting the course but it may be that something crops up unexpectedly with my helpers and I need that time away.
