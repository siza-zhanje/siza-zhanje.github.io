<h3>How is EQ different to IQ&#63;
</h3>

<div class="difference">
  <p>
  <em>EQ</em> is the ability to recognize emotion in myself and others, and to use that awareness to guide my decisions. It is a skill that I can learn and ensures success in life. 
  </p>
<p>
  <em>IQ</em>, on the other hand, is my mental ability to learn, understand and apply that knowledge with logical reasoning and abstract thinking. This ability is in born and generally determines my levels of success at education institutions.

<h3>Why is EQ important?&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>
  It affects the quality of my work and home life. If my EQ level is high, I can better empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially aware. This also helps me to be more tolerant of other people because we are all different. 
  
</p>

<p>
Paying attention to my EQ allows me to have deeper understanding of the reasons behind other people's actions. This especially important in stressful situations like conflict, change, and obstacles when how I conduct myself and others could determine team production and general success of the whole.
