  <h3> CSS Concept - Spacing </h3>

  <p> Elements on a webpage are separated from each other by spaces called margin and padding. The boundary of an element is called the border. <br>
    The size of this space determines whether the building block appears smaller or larger in relation to it nearest and/or surrounding building block.
  In this blog, I explain the differences, as well how and when they would be used.

  <p>
    <em>Margin</em> is the space around a specific building block or element. I think of it as the space that lies <strong>outside</strong> of the element.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   Since each element on the page is a defined area, the <em>border</em> is the boundary around an element.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   Finally, <em>padding</em> is the space between the content inside the element and it&#39;s boundary/edge/border.

<p>
When applying a style to a webpage, it is to the individual elements that the sale is being applied. For readability/clarity, each element should be spaced from 
The other surrounding elements by adding space between them. To add space, a value for each or all of margin, border and padding.
