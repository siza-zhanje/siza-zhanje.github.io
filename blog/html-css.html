  <h3> CSS Concept - Spacing </h3>

  <p> Elements on a webpage are separated from each other by spaces called margin and padding. The boundary of an element is called the border. <br>
  The size of this space determines whether the building block appears smaller or larger in relation to it nearest and/or surrounding building block.
  In this blog, I explain the differences, as well how and when they would be used.

<h3>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
</h3>

<div class="difference">
  <p>
<em>Margin</em> is the space around a specific building block or element. I think of it as the space that lies <strong>outside</strong> of the element.  <br>
<img src="../images/diagram-showing-margin-border-padding.png" alt="diagram of depicting how space in an element is achieved as represented by the CSS box model"
class="box-model"><br>
Since each element on the page is a defined area, the <em>border</em> is the boundary around an element.
Finally, <em>padding</em> is the space between the content inside the element and it&#39;s boundary/edge/border.

<h3>How are they used&#63;</h3> 

<div class="difference">
<p>The following code shows values set for all surrounding space for the navigation element grouping as&#58; 
  <pre>
    <code>
    margin-top: 0.5%;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-bottom: 0.5%;
  </code>
</pre>

The above screen shot shows this as applied to the navigation section of the page.

  <h3>When are they used&#63;</h3>

  <div class="difference">
  <p>
    When creating a layout of a web page, each element should be separated from the other elements on the same section
of the page.
