A story about a time you: 1. Were blocked on a simple problem: what was the
problem? In the grade book challenge, the problem was to complete the average
function. I knew very quickly how I would solve the problem. To my surprise, it
was not returning the expected results, even before running the tests. what
problem-solving techniques did you use? I went over the code I’d written
line-by-line against the thought process I’d outlined in my pseudo code a few
times. After about 30 minutes of this, I gratefully left my desk to enjoy dinner
with my family, resolving to post a question if I was still baffled within 5
minutes of retuning to my desk. During dinner, I saw that the loop I had chosen
was not starting at the correct index! how did you feel throughout the process?
I felt really frustrated because to me this was simple enough for me to bank up
time for the questions where I felt I’d need more time. what did you learn? No
error is too small. The computer need extremely precise instructions for the
output to be reliable. In this case, my own test of function was running &
returning results rather than crashing with a long list of errors. I just knew
that my test output had to pass if the test was to pass. 2. elegantly solved a
problem. what was the problem? Solving ‘whereAreYou’ in built-in methods
challenge what problem-solving techniques did you use? I set out my pseudo as
tidy brief phrases, probably the briefest by far! Re read the documentation on
the required method to apply Wrote a single line of code which passed my own
test and the required tests how did you feel throughout the process? A light
bulb came on and I appreciated the value of clear pseudo code. I was tempted to
rewrite the function as an arrow function what did you learn? Since, I’d
researched the particular string method in an earlier exercise, it cemented my
understanding and I was able to pass the test and move on quickly. Repetition is
key! It demonstrated further what an arrow function is and where it could be
useful. 3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
techniques/processes: Pseudocode 10/10 Even though the wording and/or order
changes, it gives me a way to express what I am trying to do. I can tick off
each step as done when the code works as expected. Trying something 10/10 I
usually do this when the line of code is not working as I expect. Sometimes,
it’s the order of the lines that need changing. Other times, it clarifies
whether the psuedo I’ve written makes sense. An error is a frustration usually,
but that causes me to stop and reflect on how I’m feeling at that moment. As I
now know, frustration is not going to solve anything. Rubber ducky method 6/10
It still feels strange talking to my fluffy little desk-dog! I notice that I
talk to my screen or to one of my walls mostly Reading error messages 8/10 I
read them bottom-top and look for the lines with a reference to my source code.
If I don’t understand the meaning of what I’m seeing, then I google the error.
Sometimes clarity comes. At other times, I left more confused than when I
started. Console.logging 8/10 Often my code is riddled with commented
`console.log()`s and it helps me check if what I am thinking is in line with
what the computer understands. However, I do forget to console.log() when I’ve
written a line of code that turns out to be more complicated than it needs to
be. Googling 10/10 Best if the results actually help me solve my problem.
Sometimes, I’m left with more questions than answers even after narrowing the
search. Asking your peers for help 4-5/10 This is because sometimes an answer
doesn’t come. Is that because no one knows? The question is not relevant to the
current learning? Has the question already been already been answered? I don’t
know … Asking coaches for help 10/10 The will always reply especially when the
question has been unanswered for a certain period of time. My home group
facilitator is readily available for a screen share when I’ve found myself in a
rabbit-hole or when a team member has hinted and I still don’t understand.
Improving your process with reflection 5/10 Still a Work-In-Progress mostly
because I at the end of some days, I’m exhausted. So on those days, I usually
reflect before the start of the next day. 4. Reflect on a time you were
reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. During the
last builtin-methods challenge where specific words were to be removed from a
sentence, a link to a game was posted which explained the various methods
employed to solve the problem. I hit a block as I couldn’t figure out how to
play the game and pass my code making up each function. I felt foolish posting a
question. I felt everyone else would instantly know that, the correctly inserted
code would pass the tests! Then I realised that my hesitation was more to do
with the fact that I felt mentally drained; that facing this game on another
day, I would likely have been OK. A story about a time you: 1. Were blocked on a
