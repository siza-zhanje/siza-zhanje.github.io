 <h3> Problem solving?? </h3>

  <p>
    Problem solving is the process of achieving a goal by overcoming obstacles. As humans, we solve problems in a variety of ways. The skill required in programming, is to write instructions that the computer will understand to give back what we want it to do.

  <h3>A time where I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
 
  <div class="difference">
    <h4>What was the problem&#63;</h4>
  <p>
    To complete the <em>Average function</em> in the <em>GradeBook</em> GradeBook challenge where I had to write code to calculate the average of a collection of numbers.
  </p>
      
  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did I use&#63;</h4>
  <p>
    I went over the code I&#39;d written according to my initial thoughts outlined in my <strong>pseudo code</strong>. When the <strong>reading error messages</strong> , I decided to <strong>console log</strong> the result. A <strong>google</strong> search confirmed that the formula I was using was correct. 
    </p>

    <p>
    After repeated explanations to <strong>rubber duck</strong>, I left my desk to enjoy dinner with my family, resolving to post a question if I was still baffled within 5 minutes of retuning to my desk. During dinner, I realized that the loop I had chosen was not starting at the correct position in the collection of numbers! <strong>Reflection</strong> helped me formulate what I had learnt.
  </p> 

 <h4>How did I feel throughout the process&#63;</h4>

<p>I felt really frustrated because I planned to complete the task quickly enough, to bank up time for the questions where I&#39;d need more time.
</p>

<h4>What did I learn&#63;</h4>

  <p>Not to rush because errors cost a lot of time. Especially, the &#39;small&#39; ones. Although the code was not &#39;crashing&#39; with a long list of errors, the results were simply wrong. It was also an example of the importance of checking that results are correct before declaring the job done!</p> 

</div>

<h3>A time where I elegantly solved a problem</h3>

<div class="difference">

  <h4>What was the problem&#63;</h4>
  
  <p>Solving <em>whereAreYou</em> in the Built-in methods challenge. Here I had to find the first location, from a number of possible locations,  where <em>Scooby</em> was hiding.
  </p>

  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use&#63;</h4>
  <p>
    Having set out my <strong>pseudo code</strong>, in tidy brief phrases, I studied the test code to understand the available locations to hide in. Then I <strong>Tried something</strong>, to write a function that showed the names of only those locations with <em>Scooby</em> against them. When I <strong>console log</strong>ged, I realized that it was not showing me the value of hiding as set out in the tests. So I changed the code to show the value of the location with the word <em>hiding</em>, rather than the name of the location!
  </p> 

  <h4>How did I feel throughout the process&#63;</h4>
  <p>
    A light bulb came on and I appreciated the value of clear pseudo code. It felt great to have code flow smoothly and be able to see it in advance whilst still writing it.
</p>

  <h4>What did I learn&#63;</h4>
  <p>
    The particular method I had to apply to solve the problem is one I had researched in an earlier exercise. Repetition is key helped my understanding, enabling me to pass the test and move on quickly. 	This is the one where I fully understood the usefulness of an arrow function, where a single line of code suffices.

<h3>Reflecting on how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3> 

<div class="difference">

<div class="confidence">
<p class="technique">Pseudocode</p>
<p class="score">10/10 </p>
<p class="my-feeling">
	Even though the wording and/or order changes, it gives me a way to express my approach as well as a To DO list that I can tick off when my code works as expected.
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Trying something</p>
  <p class="score">10/10 </p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
	I usually do this when the line of code is not working as I expect. Sometimes, it is the <em><strong>order</strong></em> of the lines that need changing. Other times, it clarifies whether my psuedo code makes sense. An error is a frustration that causes me to stop and reflect on how I am feeling at that moment.Since being frustrated is not going to solve anything, it may be time to walk away briefly.
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Rubber ducky method</p>
  <p class="score">6/10 </p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
It still feels strange talking to my fluffy little desk-dog! I notice that I talk to my screen or to one of my walls more often.
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Reading error messages</p>
  <p class="score">8/10 </p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
	I read them bottom-top and look for the lines with a reference to my source code. If I don’t understand the meaning of what I’m seeing, then I google the 		error.  Sometimes clarity comes. At other times, I left more confused than when I started.
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Console logging</p>
  <p class="score">8/10 </p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
	Often my code is riddled with commented `console.log()`s and it helps me check if what I am thinking is in line with what the computer understands.
	However, I do forget to console.log() when I’ve written a line of code that turns out to be more complicated than it needs to be. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Googling</p>
  <p class="score">10/10 </p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
    Best if the results actually help me solve my problem. Sometimes, I’m left with more questions than answers even after narrowing the search.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Asking your peers for help</p>
  <p class="score">4-5/10 </p>
	<p class="my-feeling">
    Sometimes my question goes un-answered. At those times, it is possibly because my peers also do not know OR are are not confident in themselves to offer a suggestion or possible idea. OR are just trying to keep up with their own work. I know this happens to me too. A few times, I have offered an answer only to find, that I was way-off the mark OR worse, completely misunderstood what was being asked!  
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Asking coaches for help</p>
  <p class="score">10/10</p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
  They always reply timely, especially when the question has been unanswered for a while. Maybe they are giving us a chance to offer help! My home group facilitator is always available for a screen share when I have found myself in a rabbit-hole or when a team member has tried and I still do not understand.
</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence">
  <p class="technique">Improving your process with reflection</p>
  <p class="score">5/10</p>
  <p class="my-feeling">
    Still a Work-In-Progress mostly because I at the end of some days, I’m exhausted. So on those days, I usually reflect before the start of the next day.
</p>
</div>

<h3>  Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3> 

<div class="difference">

<p>
  During the last builtin-methods challenge, specific words were to be removed from a sentence. A link to a game was posted which explained the various methods employed to solve the problem. I simply could not figure out how to play the game and pass my lines of code making up each function.
</p> 

<h4> Considering what made me reluctant to do so</h4>

<p>
  I felt foolish posting a question because it was obvious to me that the correctly inserted code would pass the tests! Then I realized that my hesitation was more to do with the fact that I was mentally drained. Were I facing this game on another day, I would likely have been OK.
