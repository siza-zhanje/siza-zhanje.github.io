        <h3>JS Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
          JavasScript, HTML and CSS are the main languages used to make a
          webpage. The browser uses these languages to display teh page on the
          computerâ€™s screen.

        <h3>JavaScript relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            A light bulb in your hand is an analogy of HTML, Hyper Text Markup
            Language in a web page. Each component, the cap connecting to the
            ceiling or floor or lamp socket; the glass covering, the stem etc
            are each given unique ID. However the filamament componets could be
            given a class name.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS would add the location of connection; whether the bulb glass is
            clear or coloured; the size using those IDs & classes. To switch the
            light bulb ON or OFF, change the glass covering color, determine
            brightness at various times when ON, direction of light provided
            would be determined by JavaScript; setting these actions to the
            specific components accessed by their ID or class.
          </p>

        <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            When writing lines of code in a program, the order in which these
            are read by the computer is described as Control Flow. Normally, the
            computer reads the lines, also called statements, from
            left-to-right; top-to-bottom.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/control-flow.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing the flow of control in making a cup of tea"
            class="screen-shot"
          />
          <p>
            Loops represent decisions within control flow. A loop is just that:
            it has a starting point and and ending point. In between the start
            and end points, the outcome of decisions made, determines the path
            taken to reach the decision.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What is the DOM&#63;</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Is a tree-like representation of all the objects that make up the
            structure and content of a web page. Each element is refereed to as
            a node and has only one parent. The DOM provides a way of
            interconnecting with these elements.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/DOM.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing the tree-like structure of the DOM"
            class="screen-shot"
          />
          <h4>How does it relate to CSS and HTML</h4>
          <p>
            By providing each HTML element with a unique ID, the DOM can be used
            to modify HTML and CSS elements directly within the browser using
            Google DevTools. CSS styles HTML elements using its class name;
            JavaScript uses its ID and the DOM uses both to modify both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any changes made to the page inside the DOM are not permanent, being
            lost when the webpage is refreshed. This is useful if we want to
            test the effect of modifications to the page. Fortunately, if we
            like those changes, we can still save them by mapping the source
            files within the DOM back to the local folder.
          </p>

            class="screen-shot"

        <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            To get an item out of an array, the position of the item is used.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/accessing-data-from-array.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing how data is accessed from an object"
            class="screen-shot"
          />

          <p>To get an item out of an object, the dot notation is used.</p>
          <img
            src="/images/dot-notation-object-example.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing how data is accessed from an object"
            class="screen-shot"
          />

          <img
            src="/images/data-from-object.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing how data accessed from an object is presented"
            class="screen-shot"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Functions are blocks of instructions which the computer must execute
            in the order that they are written, from top to bottom. They have a
            signature which consists of a name, whether or not data needs to be
            entered for the function to work and whether or not dat must be
            given back after the instruction block has been completed.
          </p>
