        <h3>JS Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
          JavasScript, HTML and CSS are the main languages used to make a
          webpage. The browser uses these languages to display teh page on the
          computerâ€™s screen.

        <h3>JavaScript relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Any car will take you from point A to point B. It is a question of
            how you get there. A car with a small engine (less than 2 litre
            petrol tank), going up hilly parts of the road may be slow and
            overtaking at the same time, a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would be HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. When a webpage is
            clicked, content is opened up and viewed with minimal formatting and
            layout, enabled by Markup Language - just enough to display the
            content and layout. Nothing more.
          </p>

          <!--TODO webpage with car elements in analogy??-->
          <img
            src="/images/page-as-displayed-with-html.png"
            alt="web page displayed with HTML only"
            class="screen-shot"
            style="max-width: 100%"
          />

          <p>
            A bonus from work allows you to change the body paint to any color
            of your choice, add mag wheels, lower the suspension, tint the
            windows so that you drive incognito if you wish and maybe that
            exhaust for extra sound! Now you car is attention grabbing. This is
            CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately you still have to crane your neck to reverse or
            parallel park in your tinted windows. Inside your car is a space
            next to the console where a display screen could be installed.
            Further, the boot is such that a small camera could be added and
            linked to the display screen at the console. This now means that
            when you engage the reverse gear, the camera switches on and the
            display screen shows you the boundaries for safely driving
            backwards. This ability to add elements (camera and display) to
            existing HTML & CSS plus the appropriate functionality is
            JavaScript. It enhances the user experience.

        <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            When writing lines of code in a program, the order in which these
            are read by the computer is described as Control Flow. Normally, the
            computer reads the lines, also called statements, from
            left-to-right; top-to-bottom.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loops represent decisions within control flow. A loop is just that:
            it has a starting point and and ending point. In between the start
            and end points, the outcome of decisions made, determines the path
            taken to reach the decision.
          </p>

            src="/images/control-flow.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing the flow of control in making a cup of tea"
            class="screen-shot"
          />

          <p>The above could be a set of instructions to make a cup of tea.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            To get an item out of an array, the position of the item is used.
          </p>

          <p>To get an item out of an array, the dot notation is used.</p>
