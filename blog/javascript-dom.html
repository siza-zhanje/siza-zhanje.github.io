        <h3>JS Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
          JavasScript, HTML and CSS are the main languages used to make a
          webpage. The browser uses these languages to display teh page on the
          computerâ€™s screen.

        <h3>JavaScript relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Any car will take you from point A to point B. It is a question of
            how you get there. A car with a small engine (less than 2 litre
            petrol tank), going up hilly parts of the road may be slow and
            overtaking at the same time, a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would be HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. When a webpage is
            clicked, content is opened up and viewed with minimal formatting and
            layout, enabled by Markup Language - just enough to display the
            content and layout. Nothing more.
          </p>

          <!--TODO webpage with car elements in analogy??-->
          <img
            src="/images/page-as-displayed-with-html.png"
            alt="web page displayed with HTML only"
            class="screen-shot"
            style="max-width: 100%"
          />

          <p>
            A bonus from work allows you to change the body paint to any color
            of your choice, add mag wheels, lower the suspension, tint the
            windows so that you drive incognito if you wish and maybe that
            exhaust for extra sound! Now you car is attention grabbing. This is
            CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately you still have to crane your neck to reverse or
            parallel park in your tinted windows. Inside your car is a space
            next to the console where a display screen could be installed.
            Further, the boot is such that a small camera could be added and
            linked to the display screen at the console. This now means that
            when you engage the reverse gear, the camera switches on and the
            display screen shows you the boundaries for safely driving
            backwards. This ability to add elements (camera and display) to
            existing HTML & CSS plus the appropriate functionality is
            JavaScript. It enhances the user experience.

        <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            When writing lines of code in a program, the order in which these
            are read by the computer is described as Control Flow. Normally, the
            computer reads the lines, also called statements, from
            left-to-right; top-to-bottom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loops represent decisions within control flow. A loop is just that:
            it has a starting point and and ending point. In between the start
            and end points, the outcome of decisions made, determines the path
            taken to reach the decision.
          </p>

            alt="a screen shot showing the flow of control in making a cup of tea"
            class="screen-shot"
          />
          <p>The above could be a set of instructions to make a cup of tea.</p>

        <h3>What is the DOM&#63;</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Is a tree-like representation of all the objects that make up the
            structure and content of a web page. Each element is refereed to as
            a node and has only one parent. The DOM provides a way of
            interconnecting with these elements.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/DOM.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing the tree-like structure of the DOM"
            class="screen-shot"
          />
          <h4>How does it relate to CSS and HTML</h4>
          <p>
            By providing each HTML element with a unique ID, the DOM can be used
            to modify HTML and CSS elements directly within the browser using
            Google DevTools. CSS styles HTML elements using its class name;
            JavaScript uses its ID and the DOM uses both to modify both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any changes made to the page inside the DOM are not permanent, being
            lost when the webpage is refreshed. This is useful if we want to
            test the effect of modifications to the page. Fortunately, if we
            like those changes, we can still save them by mapping the source
            files within the DOM back to the local folder.
          </p>

            src="/images/DOM-within-DevTools.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing the DOM of my blog homepage within DevTools"
            class="screen-shot"

        <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            To get an item out of an array, the position of the item is used.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/accessing-data-from-array.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing how data is accessed from an object"
            class="screen-shot"
          />

          <p>To get an item out of an object, the dot notation is used.</p>
          <img
            src="/images/dot-notation-object-example.png"
            alt="a screen shot showing how data is accessed from an object"
            class="screen-shot"

        </div>

        <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>

        <div class="difference">
          <p>
            Functions are blocks of instructions which the computer must execute
            in the order that they are written, from top to bottom. They have a
            signature which consists of a name, whether or not data needs to be
            entered for the function to work and whether or not dat must be
            given back after the instruction block has been completed.
          </p>
